Once printed, the material has isotropic mechanical properties due to chemical crosslinking. This is clear step forward from existing technologies. For the first time anywhere, and with the help of a 3D printer, this material can be processed in its liquid state; this eliminates the melting process.<\/p>\n<p>The new PU material was introduced in June of this year at PSE Europe 2017 in Munich, at the booth of ebalta Kunststoff GmbH. In a live demonstration, the LAM 3D printer processed the material with amazing results. Spectators were duly impressed.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2810\" src=\"\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/PSE_2017_LAM_PU-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/PSE_2017_LAM_PU-3.jpg 600w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/PSE_2017_LAM_PU-3-200x300.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>German RepRap pioneered liquid additive manufacturing (LAM) and presented the technology in November of 2016 at the Formnext trade show in Frankfurt. This was the first demonstration worldwide that showed how liquid materials, such as silicone, can be processed in LAM 3D printers. This so-called \u201cliquid silicone rubber\u201d opened up new possibilities for the silicone-processing market. Simultaneously, the PU material was developed with the goal to create a wide range of properties, from soft to hard. The manufacturing process produces a comparable structure to that yielded from the FFF process. However, the PU material enables the printing of highly complex parts, which may be difficult or impossible with existing injection molding technology. Most importantly, the mechanical properties are virtually identical to those of an injection-molded part. This new ability to process polyurethane-based materials opens up whole new areas of application, such as prototype construction or functional models for consumer goods. The special properties of PU can meet a variety of requirements (e.g., specific strength and flame retardant materials). Processing at room temperature allows for a highly energy-efficient printing process and low material shrinkage between 1 and 2%. This makes challenges, such as thermal warping or detachment from the print bed, things of the past.<\/p>\n<p>Polyurethanes are used predominantly as foams for insulation, mattresses, all types of upholstery, as well as paint and adhesive systems. Additional applications for PU materials are shoe soles, soccer balls, instrument panels, and most importantly, all types of seals, hoses, and sealants. Even though in most cases, the PU material in these applications remains hidden, it is used in nearly all areas of daily life. Thanks to their excellent mechanical properties, polyurethanes are suitable for special applications, such as those requiring high resistance to wear. This makes them suitable for applications in virtually all industries, especially automotive, aeronautical, and construction.<\/p>\n<h2>About German RepRap GmbH<\/h2>\n<p><strong>German RepRap GmbH<\/strong>, headquartered in Feldkirchen bei M\u00fcnchen and originally founded as <strong>German RepRap Foundation<\/strong> (GRRF) in 2010, is a German manufacturer of industrial 3D printers \u201cMade in Germany.\u201d The company develops and produces 3D printers based on RepRap technology (fused filament fabrication) and markets them in combination with software, filaments, and accessories \u2013 directly as well as through a worldwide network of qualified distributors.
