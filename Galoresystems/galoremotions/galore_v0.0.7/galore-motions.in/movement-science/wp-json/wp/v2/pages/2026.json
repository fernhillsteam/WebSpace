Build platform arrived earlier this week and I have just successfully printed my first large object with the Replicator 2. Most online businesses don&#8217;t seem to give a crap about their customers these days, but seems your one of the exceptions. Just wanted to say thank you. <\/div>\n<div class=\"wc-shortcodes-testimonial-author\">Nat Vella<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"wc-shortcodes-testimonial wc-shortcodes-item wc-shortcodes-clearfix wc-shortcodes-testimonial-left \">\n<div class=\"wc-shortcodes-testimonial-content wc-shortcodes-content\">Firstly, a big thank you to Joe for his exemplary customer service. I was out of the College for a while, but back on deck now. We installed the motherboard and had immediate success with the issue, so thank you for the delivery.<\/div>\n<div class=\"wc-shortcodes-testimonial-author\">Garth Coulter | Head of IT | Saint Ignatius&#8217; College, Adelaide<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"wc-shortcodes-testimonial wc-shortcodes-item wc-shortcodes-clearfix wc-shortcodes-testimonial-left \">\n<div class=\"wc-shortcodes-testimonial-content wc-shortcodes-content\">A big thank you to the team at Thinglab. During the many challenges faced in preparing the machines for my upcoming exhibition project, you were all gracious and professional at every turn. All problems were solved elegantly and quickly and I felt part of the maker community every time I knocked on the door. There were a couple of points in the project when I asked for help that was above and beyond the call of duty &#8211; nice one guys!<\/div>\n<div class=\"wc-shortcodes-testimonial-author\">Matt Sleeth | Artist<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"wc-shortcodes-testimonial wc-shortcodes-item wc-shortcodes-clearfix wc-shortcodes-testimonial-left \">\n<div class=\"wc-shortcodes-testimonial-content wc-shortcodes-content\">What a ride!!! First 3 months of our life as 3D commrades was nothing but HELL&#8230;extrusion issues out the rear end!:) Thankfully we got our Rep2 from Joe and the gang at Thinglab. Without their consistent and helpful support, I really feel the printer would be sitting in the corner gathering dust. The perseverance in finding a solution was commendable to say the least. Can&#8217;t thank you enough for all your help and support guys!<\/div>\n<div class=\"wc-shortcodes-testimonial-author\">Daniel Sansom-Gower | ThoughtWorks Australia<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"wc-shortcodes-column wc-shortcodes-content wc-shortcodes-one-half wc-shortcodes-column-last \">\n<div class=\"wc-shortcodes-testimonial wc-shortcodes-item wc-shortcodes-clearfix wc-shortcodes-testimonial-left \">\n<div class=\"wc-shortcodes-testimonial-content wc-shortcodes-content\">Thanks for your help the install went well and we are back up and running thanks also for the prompt service.<\/div>\n<div class=\"wc-shortcodes-testimonial-author\">Stephen Olding | Technical Manager | The University of Auckland<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"wc-shortcodes-testimonial wc-shortcodes-item wc-shortcodes-clearfix wc-shortcodes-testimonial-left \">\n<div class=\"wc-shortcodes-testimonial-content wc-shortcodes-content\">My son ( our CAD technician ) wants one for himself !

I am new to the world of 3D printing and have now had my Replicator 2X for 1 month completing 200 hours of print time with only minor fine tuning required, Joe has been there to help me out with advice along the way. The team at Makerbot also deserve a HUGE THANK YOU, the Replicator 2X is a great product and is easy to use. They have also been quick to reply to any questions relating to their software (Makerware), I cannot wait to see what Makerbot come up with next. Keep up the great work!<\/div>\n<div class=\"wc-shortcodes-testimonial-author\">Dennis Bormann | Fretek<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"wc-shortcodes-testimonial wc-shortcodes-item wc-shortcodes-clearfix wc-shortcodes-testimonial-left \">\n<div class=\"wc-shortcodes-testimonial-content wc-shortcodes-content\">I&#8217;d like to give a HUGE shoutout to Joe Farr at Thinglab in Yarraville Victoria for his amazing amount of rapid support and assistance with my order (a Makerbot Replicator 2X). He has kept me in the loop with everything I&#8217;ve asked quickly and professionally. Definitely appreciated and recommended. I thought I&#8217;d share with you this simple Tsuba (a hand guard for Kendo shinai) I printed in my printer tonight as one of my item designs. This was printed in default low quality mode, 110\u00b0C heated bed and 230\u00b0C extruder temps.<\/div>\n<div class=\"wc-shortcodes-testimonial-author\">Don Chiou | Designer<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><\/div><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":8182,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"page-templates\/page-builderfullwidth-notitle.php","meta":{"spay_email":""},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.4.1 -
