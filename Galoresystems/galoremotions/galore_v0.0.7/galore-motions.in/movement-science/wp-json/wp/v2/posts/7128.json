The solvents are vaporized, usually in a jar or a glass bowl while the model is held above to be covered with vapors. This way, the surfaces achieve glossy or mat finish, depending on the type of filament used and the layering becomes invisible.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It\u2019s difficult, though, to achieve an evenly smoothed model like the one shown below by doing this manually.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7132\" src=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/ZORTRAX_APOLLER3-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"410\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/ZORTRAX_APOLLER3-1.png 650w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/ZORTRAX_APOLLER3-1-300x189.png 300w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/ZORTRAX_APOLLER3-1-600x378.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Moreover, the remaining vapors that didn\u2019t condense on the model go straight to the room where the process is being done because there is usually no barrier preventing them from doing so.<\/p>\n<p><strong>This makes manual vapor smoothing burdensome for the\u00a0following reasons:\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Results are not\u00a0repeatable as it is\u00a0extremely\u00a0difficult to maintain the same smoothing conditions each time<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Surfaces are not smoothed uniformly because the vapors are unevenly distributed across the model<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Smoothing models with small details are extremely\u00a0difficult as they tend fade when too much solvent is applied<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>It\u2019s not safe as there is always a risk of exposure to vaporized solvents<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>But vapor smoothing, when done with skill and expertise, makes 3D printed models indistinguishable from injection molded products which is why many users do it despite the risk. But now it\u2019s possible to\u00a0make make vapor smoothing clean, automated, and most importantly safe while offering significantly higher quality finish.<\/p>\n<h3>Easier Vapor Smoothing<\/h3>\n<p>We wanted automatic vapor smoothing device to be simple: a solution where the user just opens the door, puts the models in, presses a button, and takes them out already vapor smoothed once the process is done. To make that possible we have developed the Smart Vapor Smoothing (SVS) technology that works in\u00a0Zortrax Apoller\u00a0smart vapor smoothing device.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7137\" src=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/ZORTRAX_APOLLER6-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"410\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/ZORTRAX_APOLLER6-1.png 650w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/ZORTRAX_APOLLER6-1-300x189.png 300w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/ZORTRAX_APOLLER6-1-600x378.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The device has an air-tight, double sealed smoothing chamber measuring 300x250x250 mm which is usually enough to contain a weekly output of two typical FDM 3D printers. Both acetone and MEK are supported and stored in an internal tank.<\/p>\n<h3>No More Acetone Fumes<\/h3>\n<p>Once the models are placed on the glass tray at the bottom of the chamber, the door has to be closed and the settings chosen via an intuitive touch screen. In the next step, Zortrax Apoller pumps the air out of the chamber to bring the pressure inside below the ambient level.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7134\" src=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/ZORTRAX_APOLLER4-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"410\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/ZORTRAX_APOLLER4-1.png 650w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/ZORTRAX_APOLLER4-1-300x189.png 300w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/ZORTRAX_APOLLER4-1-600x378.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This step serves two purposes. First, it prevents the vapors from getting outside. Second, it is as a secondary means to keep chamber closed, even if there is a power outage.<\/p>\n<h3>Automated Smoothing<\/h3>\n<p>Once the right pressure is reached inside and the walls of the chamber are heated up, Zortrax Apoller transfers the solvent from the tank to a container installed beneath the glass tray. That\u2019s when the actual vapor smoothing begins.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7130\" src=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/ZORTRAX_APOLLER1-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"410\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/ZORTRAX_APOLLER1-1.png 650w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/ZORTRAX_APOLLER1-1-300x189.png 300w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/ZORTRAX_APOLLER1-1-600x378.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Proprietary algorithms start to carefully change the temperature in the chamber. The process begins with heating it up enough to vaporize the solvent. Then, the vapor circulation system starts spiraling the vapors upwards to evenly cover the models. The vapors condense on the surfaces of the models because those surfaces, at this point, have lower temperature than the vaporized solvent. What\u2019s more, thin walls and tiny details of the models heat up at a faster rate than the larger shapes, so they are covered with less solvent. It is because the higher temperature prevents the vapors from condensing on such spots.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In consequence, the details get smoothed but they don\u2019t get deformed by the solvent.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7131\" src=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/ZORTRAX_APOLLER2-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"410\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/ZORTRAX_APOLLER2-1.png 650w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/ZORTRAX_APOLLER2-1-300x189.png 300w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/ZORTRAX_APOLLER2-1-600x378.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The vapors\u2019 circulation system also makes it possible for Zortrax Apoller to smooth movable mechanisms without gluing tightly interlocked parts to each other.\u00a0Once covering models with vapors is done, the walls of the condensation system get cooled down below the dew point of the vapors.<\/p>\n<p><strong>This way, the circulating vapors stop to condense on the models and start to condense on the walls instead.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>From the condensation system, the now liquid solvent flows back to the tank where it can be reused in future smoothing sessions. In the last step, Zortrax Apoller heats the chamber back up again to dry the models out.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The entire process is fully automated and takes 3 hours. Smoothed models are ready to use straight out of the chamber.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7133\" src=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/ZORTRAX_APOLLER4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"410\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/ZORTRAX_APOLLER4.png 650w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/ZORTRAX_APOLLER4-300x189.png 300w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/ZORTRAX_APOLLER4-600x378.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>But making vapor smoothing automated and efficient was one thing. Making it safe was quite another.<\/p>\n<h3>Importance of Redundancy<\/h3>\n<p>Acetone and MEK are volatile and equipment working with those solvents has to be designed with a workplace safety in mind. That\u2019s why Zortrax Apoller has multiple safety systems with multiple levels of redundancy. To explain how this redundancy works exactly, let\u2019s consider two sets of seals installed in the door to the Apoller\u2019s smoothing chamber. A system with no redundancy requires both sets of seals to work properly. If just one of this sets fails, the chamber ceases to be air-tight and the air gets inside. But Zortrax Apoller would work just fine with just one of the sets. The one set is primary, the other one is redundant, which means it\u2019s there just in case.<\/p>\n<p><strong>This kind of redundancy has been engineered into all of the Apoller\u2019s critical systems.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7136\" src=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/ZORTRAX_APOLLER5-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"410\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/ZORTRAX_APOLLER5-1.png 650w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/ZORTRAX_APOLLER5-1-300x189.png 300w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/ZORTRAX_APOLLER5-1-600x378.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s think what happens when there is a power outage. The smoothing chamber will stay closed regardless. When the power is back on, the software running the Apoller will know what has just happened and automatically decontaminate the chamber before allowing anyone to open it.<\/p>\n<h3>ATEX Certified Safety<\/h3>\n<p>Then there are electronics end electrical cords inside the device. All components which can get into contact with vapors got a\u00a0<strong>certificate of compliance with ATEX 2014\/34\/EU Directive <\/strong>regulating safety standards necessary for equipment meant for explosive atmospheres. That\u2019s what makes Zortrax Apoller safe to use even in a typical office setting.<\/p>\n<h3>What It\u2019s For?<\/h3>\n<p>There are many reasons to go for vapor smoothing besides making the models look good. Making prototypes that have the looks of end-use products is obviously an area where this kind of post-processing creates lots of added value.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7135\" src=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/ZORTRAX_APOLLER5.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"410\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/ZORTRAX_APOLLER5.png 650w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/ZORTRAX_APOLLER5-300x189.png 300w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/ZORTRAX_APOLLER5-600x378.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>But there are less obvious applications as well.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Parts working in tight fit mechanisms have less friction when their surfaces are smoothed. Less friction leads to less heat which is usually a good thing in engineering where heat dissipation is often a serious issue. Properly smoothed \u00a03D printed models can be used as patterns for investment casting. It\u2019s particularly important because surface imperfections of patterns always come out on the surfaces of final products. Because vapor smoothing superficially melts the models surfaces it also makes those models water-tight which is important in multiple industries. Zortrax Apoller can work in all those applications at scale offering reputable results It\u2019s also very efficient.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7138\" src=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/ZORTRAX_APOLLER8.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"410\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/ZORTRAX_APOLLER8.png 650w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/ZORTRAX_APOLLER8-300x189.png 300w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/ZORTRAX_APOLLER8-600x378.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Zortrax Apoller can retrieve excessive vapors, just one 300 ml bottle of solvent is enough for multiple smoothing sessions.\u00a0<strong>The Apoller can smooth the weekly output of four typical FDM 3D printers in just one day, so it scales up well to work in large 3D printing farms.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s what makes Zortrax Apoller a unique solution for automated post-processing.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"expand-contact btn buy\" href=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/contact-us\/\">contact us<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/store.thinglab.com.au\/collections\/apoller\/products\/zortrax-apoller-post-processor\" class=\"btn\">Buy Now<\/a><\/p>\n<div class=\"contact hide\">\n<div class=\"wc-shortcodes-row wc-shortcodes-item wc-shortcodes-clearfix\">\n<div class=\"wc-shortcodes-column wc-shortcodes-content wc-shortcodes-one-third wc-shortcodes-column-first \">\n<h3>Phone<\/h3>\n<p>03 9687 8638<\/p>\n<h3>Address<\/h3>\n<p>7A Kent St,<br \/>\nYarraville, VIC 3013<br \/>\nAustralia.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"wc-shortcodes-column wc-shortcodes-content wc-shortcodes-two-third wc-shortcodes-column-last \">\n<h3>Send a Message<\/h3>\n<div role=\"form\" class=\"wpcf7\" id=\"wpcf7-f27-o1\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<div class=\"screen-reader-response\"><p role=\"status\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><\/p> <ul><\/ul><\/div>\n<form action=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7128#wpcf7-f27-o1\" method=\"post\" class=\"wpcf7-form init\" enctype=\"multipart\/form-data\" novalidate=\"novalidate\" data-status=\"init\">\n<div style=\"display: none;\">\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7\" value=\"27\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_version\" value=\"5.5.6\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_locale\" value=\"en\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_unit_tag\" value=\"wpcf7-f27-o1\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_container_post\" value=\"0\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_posted_data_hash\" value=\"\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_recaptcha_response\" value=\"\" \/>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"grid_12_of_12 contact-form-full-width\">\n<div class=\"row\" style=\"margin-bottom: 12px;
