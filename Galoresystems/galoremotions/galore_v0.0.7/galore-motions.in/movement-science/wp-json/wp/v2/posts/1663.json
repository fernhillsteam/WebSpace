Whether it\u2019s making surgical suturing devices, using algorithmic folding to produce the world\u2019s longest 3D printed chain, or creating robotic grippers, Formlabs users have been at the forefront of using desktop 3D printing \u00a0to solve complex challenges.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWith today\u2019s expanded suite of materials, Formlabs is introducing the most comprehensive library of high-performance functional resins for engineering applications on the desktop 3D printing market, and making accessible industrial-grade 3D printing engineering materials at a fraction of a cost,\u201d said D\u00e1vid Lakatos, chief product officer at Formlabs. \u201cWe want to equip and enable our users with an even bigger and more powerful toolbox of high-performance resins so that they can achieve reliable, precise prints and can pursue even more remarkable endeavors in engineering, design, and manufacturing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Formlabs\u2019 High Temp Resin<\/strong> is the most capable material of its kind in temperature resistance, with the ability to withstand heat at the heat deflection temperature (HDT) of 0.45MPa of 289 \u00baC \u2014 the highest HDT on the 3D printing materials market. High Temp Resin enables users to create parts that are more temperature resistant than traditional 3D printed parts. Ideal for prototyping (injection) molding tools and testing hot air or fluid flow, this material is great for static applications that will undergo higher temperatures, or for production processes such as casting and thermoforming.<\/p>\n<p>For users looking to print parts that bend without breaking, <strong>Durable Resin<\/strong> is a wear-resistant, ductile material that simulates the stiffness and smooth, glossy finish of everyday plastics. With stiffness and \u00a0high-impact strength comparable to polypropylene (PP) plastic, Durable Resin is ideal for applications from prototyping consumer products to packaging.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Formlabs released a significantly updated formulation of the Tough material, which has been one of Formlabs\u2019 bestselling materials for engineering needs. With its ability to absorb high impact and other mechanical stressors that would normally cause 3D printed parts to snap or shatter, <strong>Tough Resin<\/strong> has been engineered for applications that require performance under stress or strain. The new formulation brings the mechanical properties of Tough even closer to those of injection-molded ABS.<\/p>\n<p>For more information about how the Form 2 and Engineering Resins help engineers and product designers build better products, please visit: <a href=\"https:\/\/formlabs.com\/industries\/engineering-product-design\/\" target=\"_blank\">https:\/\/formlabs.com\/industries\/engineering-product-design\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>About Formlabs\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Formlabs designs and manufactures powerful and accessible 3D printing systems for engineers, designers, and artists. Their flagship product, the Form 2 3D printer, uses stereolithography (SLA) to create high-resolution physical objects from digital designs. The company was founded in 2012 by a team of engineers and designers from the MIT Media Lab and Center for Bits and Atoms. With its powerful, intuitive, and affordable machines, Formlabs is establishing a new benchmark in professional desktop 3D printing. Formlabs also develops its own suite of high-performance materials for 3D printing, as well as best-in-class 3D printing software.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introducing the most comprehensive library of high-performance functional\u00a0resins for engineering applications on the desktop 3D printing market.
