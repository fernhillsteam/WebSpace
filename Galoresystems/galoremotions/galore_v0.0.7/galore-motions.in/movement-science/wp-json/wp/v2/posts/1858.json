Dentistry is well on its way to fully embracing digital workflows, replacing messy alginate impressions with digital scans and complicated manual techniques with computer-aided manufacturing.<\/p>\n<p>This should come as no surprise. Every set of teeth is unique, meaning that every dental appliance has to be custom-made. The need for mass customization, and the small size of the final products, makes this a perfect application for 3D printing. While material properties were a barrier to broader application of this technology, new biocompatible materials are enabling dentists to 3D print a growing range of products.<\/p>\n<p>To date, Formlabs dental users have completed over 150,000 prints. Today, with the launch of two\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/formlabs.com\/materials\/dentistry\/\">new Dental Resins<\/a>, Formlabs is greatly expanding the range of dental products that the Form 2 can produce. With prints every bit as accurate as larger machines that cost $75,000 or more, the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/formlabs.com\/3d-printers\/form-2\/\">Form 2<\/a>\u00a0is increasingly the go-to 3D printer for the dental professionals.<\/p>\n<h2>Meet the New Resins<\/h2>\n<p>Formlabs\u2019 new dental resins add a range of new capabilities to Formlabs printers, including crown and bridge models, splints, retainers, and soon dentures.<\/p>\n<h3>Dental Model Resin<\/h3>\n<p>Designed for crown and bridge models with removable dies, Dental Model Resin is a high precision, high accuracy resin. Print crisp margins and contacts within \u00b1 35 microns and removable dies with consistently tight fit. A smooth, matte surface finish and color similar to gypsum make it easy to switch from analog to digital model production.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1859\" src=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Formlabs-DentalModel_QuadRestoration.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"895\" height=\"597\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Formlabs-DentalModel_QuadRestoration.jpg 895w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Formlabs-DentalModel_QuadRestoration-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Formlabs-DentalModel_QuadRestoration-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Formlabs-DentalModel_QuadRestoration-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 895px) 100vw, 895px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Dental LT Clear Resin<\/h3>\n<p>A Class IIa biocompatible resin, Dental LT Clear\u2019s high resistance to fracture and wear make it ideal for splints, retainers, and other direct-printed orthodontic devices.
