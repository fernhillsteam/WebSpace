Check out our review to see how it holds up.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Designed and manufactured in the Mediterranean metropolis of Barcelona, the original BCN3D Sigma 3D printer was one of the first to make dual extrusion 3D printing more accessible to the masses. This model has continuously been refined over the years, first as the Sigma R17 and most recently as the Sigma R19.<\/p>\n<p>Released in September 2018, the latest dual extrusion machine from BCN3D is yet another new and improved version of its flagship 3D printer. This professional-grade desktop 3D printer features an Independent Dual Extruder System (IDEX), a unique approach to multi-material 3D printing that enables the two extruder heads to act (and print) independently.<\/p>\n<p>Although this is technically the same extrusion mechanism used in the original Sigma, the manufacturer has enhanced its IDEX system with new printing modes and various design upgrades. All in all, the BCN3D Sigma R19 is engineered to help users boost productivity and reduce the overall workflow.<\/p>\n<p>And wowee does it. The crystallization of some 3D printer manufacturer\u2019s offerings as near-effortless solutions for professional use cases is exemplified in the Sigma R19.<\/p>\n<p>Read on for our full verdict using this double-headed hitter of a printer.<\/p>\n<p><\/div><\/div><div class=\"container-outer space-grey\" ><div class=\"site-content container-inner\"><\/p>\n<h2>Verdict<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7986\" src=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/sigma-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/sigma-5.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/sigma-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/sigma-5-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>PROS<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Comprehensive, yet simple calibration wizard<\/li>\n<li>Exceptional out-of-the-box print performance<\/li>\n<li>Duplication and Mirror modes amp your productivity<\/li>\n<li>Mechanical hotend level correction made easy<\/li>\n<li>Simple maintenance with guides and accessories<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>CONS<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Wasteful with filament<\/li>\n<li>Lashings of adhesive essential for prints to stick<\/li>\n<li>Dual extrusion printing is still pretty slow<\/li>\n<li>Print scraps escaping into the display<\/li>\n<li>It\u2019s noisy<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The new BCN3D Sigma R19 marks an assured step forwards for BCN3D.

Evolved, updated and improved, the new Sigma takes what was great about the previous model and doubles down on almost everything.<\/p>\n<p>The distinguishing feature of the BCN3D Sigma R19 continues to be its independent dual extrusion system (IDEX). A novel system of dual material 3D printing that utilizes two separate printheads mounted to the same X-axis gantry, it is a setup that gives the printer speed and accuracy by reducing the amount of mass on the print heads.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7987\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-7987\" style=\"width: 1284px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-7987 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/sigma-5-1284x857.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1284\" height=\"857\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/sigma-5-1284x857.jpg 1284w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/sigma-5-1284x857-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/sigma-5-1284x857-768x513.jpg 768w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/sigma-5-1284x857-1024x683.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1284px) 100vw, 1284px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-7987\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">BCN3D Sigma R19, with dual printheads as part of an independent dual extrusion (IDEX) system<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>As before, this IDEX system is fed by two separate extruders in a Bowden arrangement, meaning the motors, mounted to the frame of the printer, push filament remotely through a long PTFE tube that connects to the print heads. It\u2019s a tried-and-true setup to reduce mass on the print heads and improve print quality, but it does introduce some slight limitation in the materials the Sigma can print, as we\u2019ll explain later.<\/p>\n<p>Digging into the sizable cardboard box that the Sigma R19 ships in, you are greeted by a foam shroud that secures all the bits, pieces, extras and the printer itself. Disentangling the printer from this mass is a doddle, albeit a messy one, with everything coated in a fine dusting of black foam from the cutouts. This foam sediment found its way into the PTFE Bowden tubes included with the printer, necessitating a quick blast of compressed air to clear them.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7984\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-7984\" style=\"width: 1284px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7984\" src=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/sigma-3jpg-1284x857.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1284\" height=\"857\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/sigma-3jpg-1284x857.jpg 1284w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/sigma-3jpg-1284x857-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/sigma-3jpg-1284x857-768x513.jpg 768w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/sigma-3jpg-1284x857-1024x683.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1284px) 100vw, 1284px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-7984\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Removable glass print bed with magnets for snap-in-place positioning on the machine<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>BCN3D has always been pretty generous with the tools and accessories that ship with its printers, and the Sigma R19 is no exception.

Only longer-term testing could tell. Still, E3D\u2019s reputation is such that their mere presence in the Sigma\u2019s spec sheet is a boost in itself.<\/p>\n<p>Likewise, Swedish extruder specialist Bondtech also lends its reputation to the Sigma R19 with its precision machined dual-gear system present in BCN3D\u2019s extruder assembly. Added to prevent filament skipping and grinding, we can confirm that this addition certainly serves its purpose, with a hotend blockage we experience during testing forcing the extruder motor to stall, rather than chew the filament.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7988\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-7988\" style=\"width: 1284px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7988\" src=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/sigma-7-1284x857.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1284\" height=\"857\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/sigma-7-1284x857.jpg 1284w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/sigma-7-1284x857-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/sigma-7-1284x857-768x513.jpg 768w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/sigma-7-1284x857-1024x683.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1284px) 100vw, 1284px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-7988\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tucked away out of sight at the rear of the Simga is a geared stepper motor, linked to Bondtech dual-drive toothed gears.

Tucked beneath the extruder motors at the back of the print chamber you\u2019ll find little black 3D printed boxes containing microswitches with rollers. When the filament is present the switch is depressed. When the spool runs out, and the loose end passes by the switch, it releases, triggering a pause in a print job. Simple.<\/p>\n<p>During prints that require a lot of retraction, the stepper motors tend to thump loudly. We\u2019d think twice before dropping the Sigma R19 into a quiet office environment. For all its improvements, the Sigma R19 is not a quiet 3D printer.<\/p>\n<p>Operating on 24V, the Simga\u2019s hot ends heat quickly. However, the PCB heated bed seems a bit sluggish getting up to temperature, especially toward the upper reaches of its limit. Because of this, we regularly found ourselves spending some minutes sitting around waiting for it to warm up for a job.<\/p>\n<p>Outfitted with brass 0.4mm nozzles as standard, those wanting to print faster, larger and tougher can turn to BCN3D\u2019s family of hotends, sold separately. Interchangeable in any combination across both print heads, they bolt on and off, with the only consideration being to select the appropriate hotend in the slicing software, and to recalibrate the printer to account for any level change.<\/p>\n<p><\/div><\/div><div class=\"container-outer space-grey\" ><div class=\"site-content container-inner\"><\/p>\n<h2>Dual is Cool<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7990\" src=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/sigma-10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/sigma-10.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/sigma-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/sigma-10-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Much like our initial impression of the first BCN3D Sigma, the R19 makes light work of dual extrusion, operating near-faultlessly throughout our time with it. Part of this is down to the company\u2019s line of 2.85mm filaments that, paired with the appropriate profiles in Cura, print exceptionally with a clean delineation between materials and colors.<\/p>\n<p>Even outside of BCN3D\u2019s material ecosystem, we found the Sigma R19 to perform admirably, diligently plugging away at every print we threw at it.<\/p>\n<p>A further utility comes in the addition of Mirror and Duplication print modes. Introduced with the BCN3D Sigmax late in 2017, these modes put the usually idle second print head to use, coordinating its travel and extrusion on the X-axis to match its \u2018active\u2019 counterpart, piggybacking on its travel through Y- and the bed\u2019s Z- movement.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s nice to see these modes come to the Sigma. They are, bottom line, all about efficiency and the\u00a0increase of output; all\u00a0crucial factors in for a benchtop printer angling for professional users.<\/p>\n<p>Using the two modes, naturally, divides the Sigma R19\u2019s 210 x 297 x 210 mm print volume, since the print heads share a gantry and sit on the same linear guide. It would be impossible for them to cross over.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7998\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-7998\" style=\"width: 1284px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7998\" src=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/sigma-19-1284x857.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1284\" height=\"857\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/sigma-19-1284x857.jpg 1284w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/sigma-19-1284x857-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/sigma-19-1284x857-768x513.jpg 768w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/sigma-19-1284x857-1024x683.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1284px) 100vw, 1284px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-7998\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tall prints using the BCN3D Sigma R19\u2019s Duplication mode.

Besides pushing you to the edges of the print bed \u2014 which does not hold heat as well a the center of the bed\u00a0 \u2014 this limiting space detracts a little from the potential the mode offers. With that said, BCN3D does offer double the print volume with the larger Sigmax.<\/p>\n<p>Duplication mode is a little more forgiving, splitting the print volume clean in half.<\/p>\n<p>Seeing the Sigma\u2019s portrait-style print bed split in half lengthways highlights that these new print modes were probably not designed with this machine in mind. They did debut on the much larger Sigmax, after all. However, there\u2019s no denying that Mirror and Duplication are useful abilities enhancing an already great\u00a0machine.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_8005\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8005\" style=\"width: 1284px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8005\" src=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/sigma-28-1284x857.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1284\" height=\"857\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/sigma-28-1284x857.jpg 1284w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/sigma-28-1284x857-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/sigma-28-1284x857-768x513.jpg 768w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/sigma-28-1284x857-1024x683.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1284px) 100vw, 1284px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-8005\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">An All3DP office beautification project in progress \u2014 geometric tiles, powered by the Sigma R19<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>One unfortunate consequence of dual extrusion 3D printing is that frequent filament purges are necessary to keep the hotends primed, resulting in lots of waste and the frequent need to empty the Sigma R19\u2019s waste buckets.

The former issue is more an indication of the need for an enclosure with temperature sensitive materials.

Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t have access to any during our time with the printer but did have a spool of NinjaTek\u2019s Cheetah lying around. Also rated at 95A shore hardness, the Cheetah passed through without issue, allowing us to (finally, after much trial and error) create a single-print dual extrusion wheel with tyre.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_8002\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8002\" style=\"width: 1284px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8002\" src=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/sigma-25-1284x857.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1284\" height=\"857\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/sigma-25-1284x857.jpg 1284w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/sigma-25-1284x857-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/sigma-25-1284x857-768x513.jpg 768w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/sigma-25-1284x857-1024x683.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1284px) 100vw, 1284px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-8002\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mixing ABS and NinjaTek Cheetah for a pretty rad RC tire (Model: Airless Tyre by Imbcruz, via Thingiverse)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>It\u2019s possible the line between being too squiggly for the Sigma to handle lies between 85A and 95A shore hardness.
