These are our general purpose materials for the Form 2, great for rapid prototyping, concept models, and bringing your ideas to life. Product designers, engineers, modelmakers, and professionals across industries love these materials for their high detail, smooth surface finish, and minimal post-processing and finishing.<\/p>\n<h2>Colorful Parts Straight from Your 3D Printer<\/h2>\n<p>Color helps us understand the world around us. Color can indicate which parts of a product to touch or use, direct our eyes, create contrast or cohesion, and connect a product to a particular brand family. Color can elicit emotion and shift interpretations.<\/p>\n<p>Formlabs&#8217; materials science team selects colors for functional materials, like our Engineering and Dental Resins, for\u00a0differentiation and to optimize for their respective material properties. These properties are essential for functional parts and works-like prototypes.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3015\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3015\" style=\"width: 790px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-3015\" src=\"\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/11222017_color_hero_194_blog-1024x484.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"790\" height=\"373\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/11222017_color_hero_194_blog-1024x484.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/11222017_color_hero_194_blog-600x284.jpg 600w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/11222017_color_hero_194_blog-300x142.jpg 300w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/11222017_color_hero_194_blog-768x363.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 790px) 100vw, 790px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3015\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Choose Color Resin for matte, opaque parts straight off the printer.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>For looks-like prototypes, concept models, and others parts where aesthetic is top priority, Color Kit enables you to print many models in one consistent color, right off the printer, without the additional work of finishing and painting.<\/p>\n<p>Choose Color Resin for matte, opaque parts straight off the printer, or paint another material when your needs are a bit more complex.

Form X showcases innovative tools, materials, and approaches for advanced users who want to explore the boundaries of what\u2019s possible with desktop stereolithography (SLA).<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>First, select a recipe. Formlabs has tested 16 colors, with recipes available in the included Recipe Book, or you can mix a custom color using our\u00a0Color Picker.
