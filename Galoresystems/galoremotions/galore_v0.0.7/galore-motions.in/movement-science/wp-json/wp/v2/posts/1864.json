We\u2019re excited to continue pushing new boundaries in digital dentistry together.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1865\" src=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/formlabs-3shape.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2048\" height=\"988\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/formlabs-3shape.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/formlabs-3shape-600x289.jpg 600w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/formlabs-3shape-300x145.jpg 300w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/formlabs-3shape-768x371.jpg 768w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/formlabs-3shape-1024x494.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>With the Formlabs-3Shape integration solution, dental practitioners can create guides ready for surgery by scanning with 3Shape TRIOS intraoral scanners and designing with 3Shape Implant Studio software, followed by simply hitting \u2018print\u2019 with Formlabs\u2019 PreForm software, to finally 3D printing and manufacturing the guides with Formlabs\u2019 biocompatible Dental SG resin \u2014 all within a matter of hours. While it used to take weeks, the Formlabs-3Shape integration creates a cost-effective chairside 3D printing workflow that makes even same-day guided surgery possible.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe streamlined workflow between 3Shape TRIOS Implant Studio and Formlabs printers is a tremendous benefit for doctors,\u201d said Birk Ploennigs, 3Shape, Product Director Implantology. \u201cWe now have surgeons designing and printing their own surgical guides in hours using integrated 3D printers like Formlabs \u2019 instead of waiting weeks, and at a fraction of the cost. Because of the huge time and cost savings, doctors are now using guides on every surgery when clinically applicable. This has translated into faster and more predictable treatments for their patients.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Formlabs-3Shape integrated workflow streamlines my practice and allows me to do guided surgery efficiently and affordably,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Whitley III DDS PA. \u201cI can go from patient scans, to planned case, to fully manufactured guide with only a few clicks of the mouse. It is really a significant pairing of cutting-edge technology from two innovative companies.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Further integrations across 3Shape\u2019s suite of powerful dental software, including Dental System and Orthodontic System, are under development and planned for release throughout the year. These will enable a wide range of workflows that include restorative and orthodontics study models, splints and 3D printed dentures.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About Formlabs.<\/strong><br \/>\nFormlabs designs and manufactures powerful and accessible 3D printing systems for engineers, designers, and artists.
