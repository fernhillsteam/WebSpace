Thinglab is now the Authorized Reseller for German RepRap 3D Printers in Australia. The X350 and X400 series have been especially successful, deployed in large numbers all over the world by the manufacturer German RepRap. Thinglab is offering the full German RepRap product line, including the new, large format industrial FFF Printer X1000. As most 3D printers are limited in their building volume, the X1000 allows the printing of huge objects in one job, having all the advantages of a German RepRap 3D printer designed for industrial applications. Thinglab anticipate accelerated adoption by the Manufacturing and Education market segments.<\/p>\n<p>Thinglab is based in Melbourne and provides sales and services to clients all over Australia. Thinglab is a business unit of Freespace (formerly Inition Pty. Ltd.) which first started trading in Australia over 10 years ago and has been working with 3D printers ever since. Freedspace\u2019s mission is to provide services and hardware for a huge range of 3D technologies such as VR, 3D displays, Motion Capture, 3D scanning and 3D printing.\u00a0 Thinglab has a strong in house team who pride themselves on pre and post sales customer support. Focusing on 3D Design, 3D Scanning and 3D printing technologies the Thinglab business model is to provide the best\u2013in-class 3D scanners, 3D printers, technical services and training. They focus on industry and business markets as well as educational institutions of all levels.<\/p>\n<p>Thinglab chose German RepRap as a partner because they had been looking for reliable, large volume 3D printers for some time but have found little available with the high quality they expect for their customers. They have been providing 3D printers to Australia for over 10 years but their current lineup is all based around desktop 3D printers. \u201cWe first heard of German RepRap through some reviews from a 3D printing show held in Asia. The first thing that struck us were the good reviews about quality and size of the German RepRap 3D printer range,\u201d says Joe Farr, General Manager of Thinglab, \u201cwe chose to partner with German RepRap because they give us large build volumes with German made quality and reliability.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1671\" src=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/german-reprap-var-1024x683.jpg\" width=\"868\" height=\"579\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/german-reprap-var.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/german-reprap-var-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/german-reprap-var-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/german-reprap-var-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There is a show room at the Melbourne Office, where customers can take a closer look at the products. While Thinglab is demonstrating 3D printing and 3D scanning in action, customers can ask questions. \u201cSeeing 3D printers in action is the best way to understand the technology and get a feel for the quality of the parts that can be produced. We are always happy to welcome interested persons and help them to understand the technology,\u201d says Joe Farr. Thinglab is offering an expert team with decades of 3D printing experience. They offer tailored training solutions for all of the 3D printers and can offer more general 3D printing training packages.<\/p>\n<p>Joe Farr summarizes: \u201cFor the future we expect that the German RepRap 3D printers will become extremely popular in the Australian market due to their quality and large build volumes. Our aim is to make the German RepRap printers the go to printers for manufactures and designers looking to build quality parts for prototyping or small batch production.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Thinglab is German RepRap&#8217;s first value-added reseller in Australia. &#8220;We already have a number of customers there that have received our products from Germany. With Thinglab our existing and prospective customers now have a local contact as well. We are confident this will further increase our market share for 3D printers&#8221;, says Florian Bautz, managing director of German RepRap.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Media contact German RepRap:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Lena Wietfeld<br \/>\nPhone: +49 89 248 8986-0<br \/>\nEmail: <span id=\"cloak94025\"><a href=\"mailto:presse@germanreprap.com\">presse@germanreprap.com<\/a><\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>About German RepRap GmbH<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>German RepRap GmbH <\/strong>is headquartered in Feldkirchen, Munich, and was originally founded as the <strong>German RepRap Foundation<\/strong> (GRRF) in 2010.
