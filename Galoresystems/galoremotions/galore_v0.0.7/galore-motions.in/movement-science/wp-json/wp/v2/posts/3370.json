This new metrology-grade laser scanner, which can capture data from large objects up to 110 meters away, produces high quality data with submillimeter accuracy. It also boasts superior angular accuracy to ensure even the smallest details are captured with precision. Artec Ray can scan and process data directly in the robust Artec Studio software, which can then be seamlessly exported to programs such as Geomagic Design X, SOLIDWORKS or ReCap for reverse engineering or design and construction documentation.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAt Artec 3D we\u2019ve become a trusted and respected source for handheld 3D scanning technology and software,\u201d said Artyom Yukhin, president and CEO of Artec 3D. \u201cWith the Artec Ray, we are now able to offer a full line of high-quality solutions that will enable users to 3D scan almost any object with precision, from a human fingerprint to a jet liner or a 10-storey building \u2013 both inside and out. As with all of our 3D scanners, the new Artec Ray captures data using target-free technology, ensuring the most user-friendly experience.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3363\" src=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/Artec-ray-3dscanner4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/Artec-ray-3dscanner4.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/Artec-ray-3dscanner4-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/Artec-ray-3dscanner4-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/Artec-ray-3dscanner4-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><em>The scanner can easily digitize large objects ranging from buildings to wind turbines to airplanes.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Artec Ray is well-suited for reverse engineering large objects, quality control and inspection tasks, product design, building information modeling (BIM) in the construction industry, capturing full crime scenes in the field of forensics and the historical digital preservation of monuments and heritage sites. The scanner can easily digitize large objects ranging from buildings to wind turbines to airplanes, producing 3D data with metrological precision and without the use of sticky markers or other tracking aids. Artec Ray is portable, compact and simple-to-use, as it can be set up in front of an object and can scan at the press of a button. Suited for both indoor and outdoor use, the 4-hour internal battery allows the user to operate untethered to a power source.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3362\" src=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/Artec-ray-3dscanner3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/Artec-ray-3dscanner3.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/Artec-ray-3dscanner3-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/Artec-ray-3dscanner3-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/Artec-ray-3dscanner3-600x450.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><em>The Artec Ray can be easily paired with Artec 3D\u2019s other professional-grade handheld scanners, such as Eva, Space Spider or Leo, to make for even faster scanning of large objects.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The Artec Ray can be easily paired with Artec 3D\u2019s other professional-grade handheld scanners, such as Eva, Space Spider or Leo, to make for even faster scanning of large objects. For instance, to digitize a vehicle, the user can first take four wide 3D shots from each side of the object with the stationary Artec Ray, capturing the large flat sections in minimum time. Then the user can fill in the details, such as the door handles and the grille, with an Artec handheld scanner, which gives comfortable access to every angle of geometrically complex areas. If needed, the easy-to-maneuver handheld-scanner can also be used to scan the interior, providing a full 3D model, inside and out. Melding together scans from various Artec scanners with the Artec Studio software is simple and intuitive. In addition to the export format options Artec Studio already provides, the Ray scanner will also be capable of producing point cloud formats (PTX and BTX) for a wider range of application specific software.<\/p>\n<p>To learn more about the Artec Ray, visit\u00a0Artec Ray 3D Scanner .<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Santa Clara, Calif., March 21, 2018 \u2013 Artec 3D, a world-renowned developer and manufacturer of professional 3D hardware and software, today expands its no-targets-required 3D scanning technology portfolio with the announcement of the Artec Ray.
