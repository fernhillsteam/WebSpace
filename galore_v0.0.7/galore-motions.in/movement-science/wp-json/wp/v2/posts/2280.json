And with Form Cell, we are making an efficient, scalable production solution by leveraging the Form 2, an SLA print engine that\u2019s already stood the test of printing more than 10 million parts.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Numerous companies, including global brands like Google, are already testing the new systems*. Today, New Balance announced a strategic collaboration with Formlabs to make high-performance footwear.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSLS technology enables designers and engineers to accelerate their prototyping process by combining realistic material properties with the minimization of 3D printing design constraints,\u201d said David Beardsley manager of Google ATAP Skunkworks. \u201cWith the Fuse 1, a combination of high precision parts, reduced cycle time and robust materials allow teams to easily iterate throughout the design process and accelerate from whiteboard to final parts.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBy enabling teams to easily iterate and also to directly manufacture final products, Fuse 1 and Form Cell open up a wealth of innovation flexibility within the product development cycle, from early prototyping to manufacturing,\u201d said D\u00e1vid Lakatos, chief product officer of Formlabs.<\/p>\n<p>With today\u2019s new developments, Formlabs is powering next-generation digital manufacturing and enabling mass customization through industrial 3D printing.
