They were challenged with a problem of a significant narrowing of pulmonary homograft (prosthesis) previously operated for tetralogy of Fallot, since the next similar surgery would be considered a high-risk. The alternative, the new method of treatment is the implantation of an artificial valve through the femoral vein. The catheter carrying the new valve is usually inserted by making a small incision on a patient\u2019s leg and guided up to the heart\u2019s defective area. That\u2019s the theory, but in practice the procedure is very taxing and requires a lot of experience.\u00a0Until now, the doctors planning it had to rely on grainy MRI or CT scans.<\/p>\n<h2>GOAL<\/h2>\n<p>The goal of the team of specialists from Gda\u0144sk was to make the percutaneous procedure safer and better planned. The team of Jaros\u0142aw Meyer-Szary MD, Robert Sabiniewicz PhD and the head of the Department Joanna Kwiatkowska PhD supported by cardiac surgeons and radiologists were looking for a more reliable method of planning and simulating of the operations. Before going any further, it\u2019s important to understand the current state of medical imaging. Even though, the most popular techniques like echocardiography (ECHO), computer tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are well established as standard practice, they all have their own shortcomings. The images are usually presented on a flat computer screen, while the navigation is based on a mouse and keyboard interface. Even though, it\u2019s fast and fairly intuitive, digital reconstruction is not enough to fully represent spatial relations and various complexities in all cases. The clarity of information gathered during examination is crucial for the planning. Noteworthy, there used to be no reliable method of creating a tangible model of living patient\u2019s organs. Models done postmortem are of no use, as they could only serve educational purposes. All has changed with the rise of 3D printing technology.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3270\" src=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/ZORTRAX-Case-Study-GUM-valve1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"870\" height=\"550\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/ZORTRAX-Case-Study-GUM-valve1.jpg 870w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/ZORTRAX-Case-Study-GUM-valve1-600x379.jpg 600w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/ZORTRAX-Case-Study-GUM-valve1-300x190.jpg 300w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/ZORTRAX-Case-Study-GUM-valve1-768x486.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_10083\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pulmonary valve<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>At the beginning, a 3D printer was considered only as an efficient medium for creating educational models for students. Nevertheless, even experienced surgeons soon realized the potential of the device. What used to be hard to spot and confined to a computer screen, became tangible and available for closer inspection. It\u2019s particularly true regarding rare conditions and deformations. After a period of making teaching aids, the specialists have started to make models of actual medical cases.<\/p>\n<h2>PROCESS<\/h2>\n<p>The starting point of every organ\u2019s model is the same \u2013 CT or MRI scan. The cardiologist defines the area of interest and the radiologist sets up the scanning parameters. The grainy and crude shape of the scanned area must be rendered free of all noise and artifacts. It\u2019s extremely important to remove all redundant elements, as they might distort the model. Although, there are some algorithms that help with the removal, the majority of it must be done by a skilled physician. However helpful, programs are still prone to error.<\/p>\n<p>Next comes the elimination of bones, soft tissues and parts of the organ that are irrelevant. This process is called\u00a0segmentation. Isolating the area of interest requires not only an anatomical knowledge, but also an insight into the patient\u2019s case. After all, the model\u2019s role is to answer certain questions. The whole process usually takes a couple of hours, all depending on the resolution of the image and its complexity. It is considered the most difficult part of the model\u2019s creation.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-3268\" src=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/ZORTRAX-Case-Study-GUM-heart-model-doctor1-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/ZORTRAX-Case-Study-GUM-heart-model-doctor1-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/ZORTRAX-Case-Study-GUM-heart-model-doctor1-600x800.jpg 600w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/ZORTRAX-Case-Study-GUM-heart-model-doctor1-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/ZORTRAX-Case-Study-GUM-heart-model-doctor1.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_10073\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Partial heart model: narrowing of pulmonary homograft. 3D printed with Z-GLASS for more precise testing<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>After final refinements in a 3D modeling program, models are sent to\u00a0Z-SUITE\u00a0software. Easy and intuitive, the software leads the creators through the preparation process. No advanced know-how is required, as all parts of Zortrax Ecosystem are designed to work together seamlessly. With the model ready and sliced,\u00a0Zortrax M200\u00a0begins its work. Printing time depends on the model and chosen material. In the case of educational models, the specialists choose\u00a0Z-ULTRAT, as it\u2019s durable and long-lasting. Furthermore, a wide range of its colors allows to print complex models showing multiple layers of organs of the system. For the stenosed pulmonary homograft\u00a0Z-GLASS\u00a0material was used, because of its semi-transparent characteristic. It greatly facilitated the work during the operation\u2019s simulations.<\/p>\n<h2>RESULT<\/h2>\n<p>The experience gained while making tutoring tools, helped the team in mastering the technique. Now, they are able to create the models within 24 hours, truly in accord with the ideals of rapid prototyping. There\u2019s more to the model\u2019s use for planning purposes. To begin with, designing of the implants is considerably easier. Operations became safer, faster and based on detailed information. Furthermore, they help specialists to explain the procedure to patients and their families. It\u2019s essential, as it not only promotes knowledge about the patient\u2019s condition, but also helps to understand the difficulties and complexity of the proposed treatment methods. For many, such a demonstration has a soothing and reassuring effect. After procedures, models serve students during the courses. The specialists from the Medical University of Gda\u0144sk already have quite a collection. Its value is hard to measure, as such aides were unavailable before.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3267\" src=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/ZORTRAX-3D-printed-heart.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"870\" height=\"550\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/ZORTRAX-3D-printed-heart.jpg 870w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/ZORTRAX-3D-printed-heart-600x379.jpg 600w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/ZORTRAX-3D-printed-heart-300x190.jpg 300w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/ZORTRAX-3D-printed-heart-768x486.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_10072\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">3D printed heart model of 4-year-old born with a complex congenital heart defect.

Zortrax M200 helped them make a complex procedure a little easier and more comprehensible. Furthermore, the growing catalogue of models allows teachers to prepare future physicians. While anatomically correct models are commonly available, replicas of organs altered by diseases are hard to come by. Interestingly, recently introduced external materials feature of Z-SUITE spur the next idea. With a flexible material, a specialist could create models that closer represent the organ\u2019s structure and composition. Fortunately, they no longer have to experiment with third party materials.<\/p>\n<p>All because of the unique features of\u00a0Zortrax Inventure. Highly precise and outstandingly reliable, the newest 3D printer in Zortrax portfolio, is dedicated to all demanding professionals. But, what really makes it exceptional, is the material range. Zortrax Inventure prints using two extruders, one for the base and the second for support material. Support structures printed by Zortrax Inventure allow for creation of uniquely complex models due to being dissolvable in water. In addition, hollow objects, like for example the veins or arteries, require little to none post-processing to achieve. 3D printed models are simply placed inside the DSS Station and after a while, they are rendered free of all support structures.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3271\" src=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/ZORTRAX-Case-Study-GUM-Z_SEMIFLEX.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"870\" height=\"550\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/ZORTRAX-Case-Study-GUM-Z_SEMIFLEX.jpg 870w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/ZORTRAX-Case-Study-GUM-Z_SEMIFLEX-600x379.jpg 600w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/ZORTRAX-Case-Study-GUM-Z_SEMIFLEX-300x190.jpg 300w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/ZORTRAX-Case-Study-GUM-Z_SEMIFLEX-768x486.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_10092\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Narrowing of pulmonary homograft 3D printed with Z-SEMIFLEX 3D material<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>That alone makes Zortrax Inventure an ideal device for making intricate objects, but recently the 3D printer gained new exclusive capabilities. Particularly important to the medical specialists,\u00a0Z-SEMIFLEX\u00a0material was added to its material range. Based on TPU-98A, the material is a combination of rubber and plastic. It is elastic enough to squeeze but it also comes back to its original form. At the same time, it is highly resistant to abrasion and tearing. Z-SEMIFLEX material is a solution for making models requiring flexibility and durability. Thus, it might replace the stiff materials previously used for making models of human organs.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>by Micha\u0142 Kuli\u015b (Lifted from zortrax.com) BACKGROUND Circulatory system is responsible for a proper flow of blood throughout the organism.
