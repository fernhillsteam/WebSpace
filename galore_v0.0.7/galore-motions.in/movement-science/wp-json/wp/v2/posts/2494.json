The new filaments ASA, Performance ABS, and ESD ABS are available immediately. In addition, the already very popular PET-G filament is now available in gray, and the flexible TPU93 filament is now available in black.<\/p>\n<p>Due to intense demand for electrically conductive filament, German RepRap now offers ESD ABS. Objects printed from ESD ABS are particularly suitable for applications where electrostatic charges can cause damage. Since ESD ABS discharges static electricity very well, it can be used to avoid explosions or reduced performance. This property is ideal for fabricating mounting devices for electronic components and for the fuel storage and delivery space. For production applications that involve powder, dust, or vapor, ESD ABS can also prevent particles from being attracted by the plastic objects. German RepRap ESD ABS filament is available in black as a 0.75 kg spool with a diameter of 1.75 mm as well as a 2.10 kg spool with a diameter of 1.75 mm.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2498 alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/GRR_ESD-ABS_schwarz-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"790\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/GRR_ESD-ABS_schwarz-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/GRR_ESD-ABS_schwarz-600x450.jpg 600w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/GRR_ESD-ABS_schwarz-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/GRR_ESD-ABS_schwarz-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 790px) 100vw, 790px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The new German RepRap ASA filament is an acrylonitrile-styrene-acrylate copolymer, and it is used as an \u201coutdoor\u201d alternative to ABS. ASA features higher thermal dimensional stability than ABS and is UV and chemical-resistant, unlike ABS. Its high impact strength is similar to ABS, and due to its technical properties, it is very suitable for technical (functional) components. German RepRap ASA filament is available in natural color as a 0.75 kg spool with a diameter of 1.75 mm as well as a 2.10 kg spool with a diameter of 1.75 mm.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2497 alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/GRR_ASA_natur-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"790\" height=\"444\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/GRR_ASA_natur-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/GRR_ASA_natur-600x338.jpg 600w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/GRR_ASA_natur-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/GRR_ASA_natur-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/GRR_ASA_natur.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 790px) 100vw, 790px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The new Performance ABS features are comparable to the mechanical\/thermal properties already available with the Standard ABS, but with considerably higher resistance to thermal warping. This simplifies the process of printing complex, filigree, or large objects from ABS.

The material is soft, resistant to UV and ozone, as well as weather and abrasion-resistant. German RepRap\u2019s Filament TPU 93 excels due to its extremely high flexibility: In measurements in accordance with DIN EN ISO 527 the material reached an elongation at break of 500%, and the Shore hardness is 93. The black TPU filament is now also available as a 0.75 kg spool with a diameter of 1.75 mm as well as a 2.10 kg spool with a diameter of 1.75 mm.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-2496\" src=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/GRR_TPU93_schwarz-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"790\" height=\"444\" \/><\/p>\n<p>PET-G features optimal mechanical properties and excellent thermal plasticity. PET-G is a type of thermoplastic polyester, produced by polycondensation, and it has a variety of uses. PET-G is polar, which causes strong intermolecular forces. In addition, the molecule is linear, without any cross-linking. Both are prerequisites for partially crystalline areas and fibers. These attributes are responsible for the high breaking strength and a thermal dimensional stability up to a temperature of about 176 \u00b0F (80 \u00b0C). The material is currently available in gray, as a 0.75 kg spool with a diameter of 1.75 mm and as a 2.10 kg spool with a diameter of 1.75 mm.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2507\" src=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/GRR_PETG_grau-web-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"496\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/GRR_PETG_grau-web-1.jpg 800w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/GRR_PETG_grau-web-1-600x372.jpg 600w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/GRR_PETG_grau-web-1-300x186.jpg 300w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/GRR_PETG_grau-web-1-768x476.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>All materials are sold exclusively by German RepRap and certified German RepRap resellers.
