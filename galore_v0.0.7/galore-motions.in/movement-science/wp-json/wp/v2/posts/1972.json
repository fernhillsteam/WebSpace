This requires remembering to remove parts at the right time so they don&#8217;t over-soak and warp.<\/p>\n<p>Form Wash automates this process. Parts can be transferred directly from the printer to Form Wash, still on the build platform, or removed and placed in the basket. Once you set the time and press start, you can simply walk away, for as long as you want.<\/p>\n<p>While you\u2019re gone, Form Wash\u2019s impeller agitates IPA to flow around your printed parts. When washing is complete, the basket and platform automatically rise out of the IPA. Voila: impeccably cleaned parts, ready when you are.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1973\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1973\" style=\"width: 895px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-1973 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/FormWash_Open-blog-post.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"895\" height=\"456\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/FormWash_Open-blog-post.jpg 895w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/FormWash_Open-blog-post-600x306.jpg 600w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/FormWash_Open-blog-post-300x153.jpg 300w, https:\/\/thinglab.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/FormWash_Open-blog-post-768x391.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 895px) 100vw, 895px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1973\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Form Wash streamlines cleaning 3D printed parts, automatically agitating IPA and raising parts up when cleaning is complete.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Form Wash also includes a storage area to keep finishing tools tidy, plus a hydrometer tool that lets you know when it\u2019s time to change out the IPA for a fresh batch.<\/p>\n<h2>Post-Curing Tuned and Tested for Formlabs Materials<\/h2>\n<p>Post-curing maximizes material properties for SLA prints, improving parts\u2019 strength and performance.<\/p>\n<p>Form Cure is designed and extensively tested to achieve optimal post-curing for Formlabs resins, providing a reliable, professional post-curing solution.
