The content is also available via Microsoft&#8217;s dedicated Halo online service, Waypoint.

For the Terminals, several main character performances were captured, and later integrated with key-framed animation created using MAXON\u2019s CINEMA 4D for a look that was both organic and dynamic.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe low equipment cost and ease at which iPi Motion Capture integrated with our existing CINEMA 4D workflow meant that captured performances could be a reality for us rather than a pipe dream&#8221; Kirby says.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>According to Sequence Group Producer Dan Sioui, one scene in particular in which one character gets shot by another and dies a dramatic death, asked a lot of the iPi Soft technology.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIn the scene the character gets shot, falls to one knee and is shot again and crumbles to the ground,\u201d Sioui says. \u201cWe aimed for a realistic feel and iPi Motion Capture helped achieve this dramatic moment in a way we couldn\u2019t otherwise. Ian was able to act out the scene exactly the way he envisioned it.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Sioui adds, \u201cThe Halo audience is extremely sophisticated and the knowledge they have about the game and its evolution is mind-blowing. We knew we needed to maintain that level of quality for most anticipated videogame release of 2012. We are very pleased with the results iPi Motion Capture delivered.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Sequence Group is just one of many videogame production studios and developers who are turning to iPi Soft for its motion capture needs. Others include BioWare, Mission Critical Studios (developers of mobile games), N3V Games, Realm Forge, Red Cartel, Cyanide Studio and Game Pulp. That list should grow when iPi Motion Capture becomes available through Valve\u2019s Steam Store and its 35 million users later this month.<\/p>\n<p>For Wanda Meloni, industry analyst and editor of the industry must-read Gaming Business Review notes that \u201cMotion capture has become an indispensible tool in the videogame development arena \u2013 particularly among indie developers who are impacting the industry greatly thanks to the creative freedom tools like iPi Motion Capture provide,\u201d Meloni notes. \u201cLooking ahead, I see more demand for tools like iPi Motion Capture both on the development and production side, as well as with gamers themselves.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>About iPi Soft: Launched in 2008 by CEO and Chief Technology Architect Michael Nikonov, iPi Soft, LLC is the Moscow-based developer of iPi Motion CaptureTM, a markerless motion capture software tool that uses sophisticated image processing and computer vision algorithms to recognize and track the human body.
